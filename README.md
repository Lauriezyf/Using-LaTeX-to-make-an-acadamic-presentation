# Using LaTeX to make an acadamic presentation

This is an exemple to show how to use LaTeX to make an acadamic presentation. 

Based on my graduation project "Optimization of the Adaptive Matching Method for Indoor Environment Based on Binocular Vision", I choose LaTeX to acomplish my project presentation and achieve a awesome result. I also recommend you to coding LaTeX on texmaker. It is an execellent software for LaTeX learners.
